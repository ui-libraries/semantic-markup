## Project Overview

### What it is
[project] is...  

### Background
In July 2013, backed by an internal innovation grant, the Digital Research & Publishing (DRP) unit of Unviersity of Iowa set out to develop of a simple online tool for crowdsourcing the semantic markup of digitized textual resources, using the recently transcribed Szathmary Culinary Manuscripts Collection as a prototype. Building on the success of the [DIYHistory transcription project](http://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/), this tool would invite users to highlight and identify the constituent parts (i.e. ingredients, measurements, instructions, etc.) of these historic recipes, much like the NYPL [“What’s on the Menu” project](http://menus.nypl.org/). A successful prototype would allow for an admin user to design markup tasks for any genre of text, for example, diaries, letters, novels, etc., to create a mediated but engaging experience for a crowdsourcing project participant.

### Design Principles
We looked to experts in the crowdsourcing field [1] and our own experience building [DIYHistory](http://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/) to develop some basic design principles for this project:
* **Participation should be gratifying**-- Users should be rewarded with some kind of feedback that reinforces the value of their contributions. It should be immediately obvious to the user what the value-add is. This could be achieved through visualizations of progress, demonstrations of applications built upon their work, [what else?]
* **Tasks should be simple and straightforward**--This could be achieved through sequences of tasks within an uncluttered workspace.
* **The application should be comfortable and enjoyable to use on a variety of devices**--Responsive design, tools/tasks that "fade" into the background.
* **Crowdsourcing jobs should be relatively easy for admin users to design**--Using templates, offering existing schemas could help with this.
* **The application should be flexible enough to support a variety of uses**--Markup rules should be schema-agnostic. Accept a number of different input formats--html, txt. 

### Technology
[Stuff about HTML5, RDFa, (JSON-LD, if we end up using it) javascript and meteor]
